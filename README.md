# battlecats

## Before you start:
Make sure that you replace the existing path to the cat sprites (in main.rc) to the path specific to your computer.  To do this, simple copy the paths for the two image files in the repository after you've cloned it, and then paste the paths in the impl App section of the code in main.rc.

## To run this code
Type "cargo build" to build the project, and then "cargo run" to start the game.
